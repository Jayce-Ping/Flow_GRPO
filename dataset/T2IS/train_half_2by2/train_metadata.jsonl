Their journey from conceptual sketches to airborne triumph faces financial hurdles, technical failures, and public skepticism, but their unwavering belief in progress drives them toward a achievement that will change transportation forever. Background Story: Lord Pembroke's fascination with flight began after witnessing early glider experiments. His team includes a brilliant but reclusive mathematician, a former Royal Engineer with practical mechanical skills, and an ambitious financier who sees the invention's potential for profit. Main Character: Lord Henry Pembroke - A nobleman in his late 40s with a distinguished mustache and wire-rimmed glasses, his tailored waistcoat hiding hands stained with oil from hours spent in the workshop. Panel Descriptions: 1. The team brainstorms in a cluttered workshop, blueprints spread across tables as they debate aerodynamic principles and engine designs. The workshop is filled with drawings, models, and mechanical parts. The team's discussion is intense, with each member contributing their expertise. 2. Steam-powered machinery clanks and hisses as the inventors weld and assemble the flying machine's framework, their faces illuminated by torchlight. The workshop is alive with activity. The inventors work diligently, constructing the framework with precision and care. 3. In a large hangar, the completed machine undergoes testing, its wings flexing slightly as the engine builds pressure and the team makes final adjustments. The hangar is spacious, allowing the machine to be fully assembled and tested. The team makes last-minute adjustments, ensuring everything is secure. 4. The flying machine ascends into the London sky, its inventors cheering and waving to the crowd below as it circles St. Paul's Cathedral before landing smoothly. The machine glides gracefully through the air.
