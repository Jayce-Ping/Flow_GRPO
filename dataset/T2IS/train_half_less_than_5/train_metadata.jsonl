Background Story: Dr. Kowalski's project was initially met with skepticism, but early successes have given way to unexpected complications as Unit R-7's emotional development surpasses predictions. The robot's journey forces everyone involved to question the nature of consciousness and humanity's responsibility toward its creations.
