The cowboys quickly respond, drawing their guns and preparing to defend their cattle. 5. After a tense standoff, the outlaws retreat, the cowboys tending to their wounded comrades as the herd settles back into a nervous calm. The standoff ends with the outlaws fleeing. The cowboys attend to their injured friends, showing camaraderie and concern. 6.
