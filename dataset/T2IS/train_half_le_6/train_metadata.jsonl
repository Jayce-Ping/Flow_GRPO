Navigating a world of smoky bars, seedy underworld contacts, and dangerous secrets, Malone must piece together clues before the case slips into the shadows forever. Background Story: New Umbra, a city perpetually shrouded in fog and the stench of industrial pollution, is a place where power corrupts and truth is a commodity. Detective Malone, haunted by past failures, sees this case as his chance for redemption\u2014or perhaps his final downfall. Main Character: Detective Sean Malone - A middle-aged man with a weathered face, stubble, and tired eyes that miss nothing. He wears a trench coat perpetually stained with coffee and cigarette smoke, his badge hanging loosely on a chain around his neck. Panel Descriptions: 1. In his cramped office, dim light filtering through grimy blinds, Malone answers a mysterious phone call that sets the investigation in motion. The office is cluttered with files and photographs. Malone's expression shows his skepticism but also his professionalism. 2. At the smoky Blue Parrot Lounge, Malone meets a nervous informant who slides a crumpled photograph across the table before disappearing into the crowd. The lounge is filled with shadows and the sound of a piano. Malone's eyes narrow as he examines the photo. 3. Under police tape fluttering in the breeze, Malone examines a crime scene where a single rain-soaked hat lies abandoned, its owner nowhere to be found. The crime scene is deserted except for Malone. His focused gaze sweeps over every detail. 4. In a narrow alleyway reeking of garbage, Malone confronts a shadowy figure whose smirk fades as the detective reveals he knows far more than expected. The alley is dimly lit, and the figure's nervousness is palpable. Malone's voice is calm but threatening. 5. The final panel reveals Malone standing in a dimly lit room, the culprit's identity illuminated by a single ray of light cutting through the darkness, his voice echoing with a confession. The room is tense, with Malone's silhouette framed against the light.

He's wearing a weathered leather jacket and pith helmet, machete in hand, pushing through thick vines and foliage.

The jungle is lush with various shades of green, tall trees towering overhead, and exotic flowers peeking through the undergrowth.

Its eyes blaze with supernatural energy, and its massive form towers over Jack. The guardian's features are a mix of human and animal, radiating ancient power. Jack is shown in a defensive stance, his expression a mix of surprise and determination. The treasure glows in the background, casting eerie shadows across the chamber. The contrast between the stone guardian and the human adventurer emphasizes the supernatural nature of the encounter.", "Panel 6: The temple is collapsing, with rocks and debris falling all around. Jack is sprinting through a crumbling corridor, his face set in grim determination. Dust fills the air, and cracks spider across the walls and ceiling. Behind him, the roars of the guardian and the sounds of destruction echo. Shafts of outside light break through the collapsing structure, guiding Jack towards the exit.
