With indigenous guides and cutting-edge equipment, they brave dangerous wildlife, ancient traps, and their own personal demons to uncover truths that could rewrite history. Background Story: Dr. Hart's fascination with the legend began during her graduate studies, when she discovered anomalies in ancient texts suggesting the city's existence. Now, with funding secured and a multidisciplinary team assembled, she's ready to test her theories against the rainforest's challenges.

Her green eyes reflect both scholarly curiosity and physical resilience. Panel Descriptions: 1. The team assembles in a remote village, loading supplies onto pack animals and checking their equipment one last time before departure. The village is small and rustic. The team's preparation is thorough, ensuring they have everything needed for the expedition. 2. The expedition travels by boat along a winding river, the jungle closing in around them as exotic birds call from the canopy above. The river is narrow and surrounded by dense vegetation. The team navigates carefully, taking in the sights and sounds of the rainforest. 3. Ancient stone structures emerge from the vegetation, their carvings hinting at a sophisticated culture that once thrived here. The structures are overgrown with plants. The team examines the carvings, speculating about their meaning and origin. 4. Inside a temple complex, the explorers carefully navigate pressure-sensitive floors and swinging blades, their torches illuminating hidden mechanisms. The temple interior is dark and filled with traps. The team proceeds cautiously, using their knowledge and equipment to avoid triggering dangerous mechanisms. 5. As they document their findings, the team encounters a tribe of indigenous people who view the city as sacred ground, their presence adding a new layer of complexity to the expedition's goals.
